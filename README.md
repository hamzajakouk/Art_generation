## Introduction

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun and interesting optimization techniques in deep learning. It merges two images, namely: a <strong>"content" image (C)</strong> and a <strong>"style" image (S)</strong>, to create a <strong>"generated" image (G)</strong>. The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S. 

In this project, we are going to combine the Mosque of Hassan II in Casablanca (content image C) with the impressionist style (style image S) to generate the following image:

<img src="images\Capture.png" style="width:750px;height:200px;">

 Let's get started!

## Transfer Learning


Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning. 

You will be using the eponymously named VGG network from the [original NST paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) published by the Visual Geometry Group at University of Oxford in 2014. Specifically, you'll use VGG-19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network. This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the shallower layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers).

## Implementations
Here's what our program be able to do:

1. Load the content image 
2. Load the style image
3. Randomly initialize the image to be generated 
4. Load the VGG19 model
5. Compute the content cost
6. Compute the style cost
7. Compute the total cost
8. Define the optimizer and learning rate
